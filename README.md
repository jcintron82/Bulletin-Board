**How It's Made:**

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug

The application skeleton was spun up via express-generator and features a form which captures user inputted data on submit. The data is saved in an an array which is parved via forEach(), returning each rendered item. The applicaiton is fully mobile responsive. 

**Lessons Learned:**

The importance of pre code planning. During this project I found that having planned out the flow of the site beforehand would've helped my workflow greatly in making the app.
