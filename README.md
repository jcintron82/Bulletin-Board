<b>The Why</b>

My reasoning behind making this project ultimately was to test and implement what I had recently learned in regards to Node and Express. As a developer, I felt comfortable enough around the Front-End to spin up a UI or similar but noticed some huge holes in my projects; namely data storage and API key security. This is what led me down the road to learning Node and Express and eventually, to creating this project. 


<b>The How</b>

As stated, this project was created using Node.js, Express, JavaScript and CSS with Pug as the templating engine. The skeleton of the app was spun up via the Express-Generator command and there are no CSS libraries on the front-end. 

<b>The What</b>

What I learned from this project? A lot! Besides the obvious stuff that comes with learning a new technology or framework, I learned the importance of really planning out the design of an application in a detailed manner. Before this, working on only front-end focused projects, I *would* plan but it definitely could've used more detail. I found that during this project (mainly in importing to my templating engine), planning a detailed architechture of the file(s) before jumping into it would've helped immensely at some parts.
